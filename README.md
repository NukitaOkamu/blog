# NukitaOkamu's AI Blog

Welcome to my blog repository! This is where I document my projects, thoughts, and experiments, with a primary focus on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and its applications. Here, you’ll find detailed write-ups about my work, including code, insights, and lessons learned. Most posts will link to related project repositories for those who want to dive into the code.

## About This Blog

I’m passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, and this blog serves as a platform to share my journey. Expect content ranging from machine learning pipelines to natural language processing (NLP) systems, often paired with Python, APIs, and innovative tools like large language models (LLMs). Whether you're a developer, data enthusiast, or just curious, there’s something here for you!
